CS142: Project-8, Problem 1 AJAX abstraction
Chris Williams / ccwillia

My AjaxRequest.js file wraps the logic of AJAX request into a constructor
which establishes the method and URL to which requests are made, and an 
execute method to which a parameter string can be passed for one or more
requests to be made.

This implementation could be used to make arbitrary AJAX GET/POST requests,
and would enable arbitrary requests for simple queries. You could re-use it 
in the context of other live searches (for users or comments), for 
changing how tags are made (e.g., viewing and making new photo tags on the same
web page with AJAX requests POSTing a new tag and displaying it immediately
upon the response), or for immediate form validation as seen on several 
sites.
